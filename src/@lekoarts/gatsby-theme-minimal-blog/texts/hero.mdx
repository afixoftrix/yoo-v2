 (Ateide kinda means "Howdy")?

I'm Unwana, a carbon based life form putting my fingers and a keyboard in different (almost random) orientations hoping that when I stop I can convince people to update their JIRA boards positively.

This is a place to things I find interesting or just random thoughts. 

Oh yea, there should be some projects somewhere too.
